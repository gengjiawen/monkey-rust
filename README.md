## Whatâ€™s Monkey?

Monkey has a C-like syntax, supports **variable bindings**, **prefix** and **infix operators**, has **first-class** and **higher-order functions**, can handle **closures** with ease and has **integers**, **booleans**, **arrays** and **hashes** built-in.

Official site is: https://monkeylang.org/. It's has various implementation languages :). 

There is a book about learning how to make an interpreter: [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/#the-monkey-programming-language). This is where the Monkey programming language come from.
